## About this blog
The intention of this blog is to be a place for me to share my evolving understandings of software engineering and Buddhism.
Posts tagged [encoding][encoding] will be practical walkthroughs of a software engineering problem I have encountered and the steps I took to solve it.
Posts tagged [impermanence][impermanence] will be practical examples of situations in life where an understanding of impermanance has helped me in some way.
Posts tagged [understandings][understandings] will (at least for now) just include all posts.
